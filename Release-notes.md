BE-terna is committed to delivering regular updates for BE-terna localization customers. 
There is not a predictable number of updates that BE-terna is committed to in a year period, but rather new releases are made:
-	to assure the compatibility of BE-terna localization with the D365FO versions that are not out of service by Microsoft,
-	to provide our clients with new features in BE-terna localization,
-	to provide our clients bug fixes for already existing functionalities in BE-terna localization.

The version of BE-terna packages follow the latest releases of Microsoft and is supported only for the Microsoft D365FO releases that are in service (more about D365FO service availability can be found on Microsoft's official site â€“ Service update availability ).

Customers can take up each update or neither based on the release notes information about the type of the changes that are included in a specific release:
- When a **Dependency update** type is announced, it means that a customer using this updated functionality needs to take up such a release to avoid malfunction of their D365FO system with BE-terna localization when, otherwise the customer can skip such a release.
Example:
    - Microsoft makes a (breaking) change of a specific functionality in version 10.0.34,
    - BE-terna releases a new package dependent on 10.0.34,
    - Customer needs to take up this release at the same time when updating D365FO to version 10.0.34 or later,
    - Such release is not compatible with 10.0.33 and earlier versions.
- When a **New feature/Changed feature** type is announced, it means that a customer interesting in using this feature should take up such a release, otherwise the customer can skip it.
- When a **Bug fix** type is announced, it means that a customer using the functionality for which this type of change is announced needs to take up such a release to avoid having a bug in their D365FO system with BE-terna localization, otherwise the customer can skip such a release.
