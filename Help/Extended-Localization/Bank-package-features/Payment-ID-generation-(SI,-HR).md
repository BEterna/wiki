# How To: Generate Payment ID

This topic provides country/region-specific information about the locally used Payment IDs, which are often mandatory 
information when making payments in Slovenia in Croatia. Payment IDs need to be generated according to local formats. In order to simplify and automate Payment ID generation in an adequate form, this extended localization feature has been developed.

Payment ID can be generated for outgoing documents if enabled so in Accounts receivable parameters. This extended localization feature also enables users to set different rules for generating payment IDs for all customers, customer groups, or individual customers; for different types of transactions and billing classifications. For documents, issued in Slovenia, the calculation of reference number is supported for the following models: SI00, SI01, SI02, SI03, SI04, SI05, SI06, SI07, SI08, SI09, SI10, SI11, SI12, SI18, SI19, SI28, SI38, SI40, SI41, SI48, SI49, SI51, SI55, SI58, and SI99. After invoice posting, the model is simply copied from the settings, the control number is calculated depending on the model. The control number for the RF model for invoices within the EU is also calculated upon invoice posting. It depends on the reference number, which is allocated after the invoice posting.
