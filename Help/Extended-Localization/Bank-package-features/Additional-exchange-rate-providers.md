# Import Additional Exchange Rates from Providers

As standard D365 functionality does not support some of the locally used exchange rate providers, often requested by local companies, this extended localization feature enables the most commonly used providers within the region.

The following additional exchange rates providers are available as part of this localization package: Bank of Slovenia, Croatian national bank, National bank of Serbia and National bank of Macedonia. Exchange rates from the listed providers can then be imported and used throughout D365 using standard features.

## Configure exchange rate providers

For exchange rates to be imported, exchange rate providers need to be defined. Within ADLoc following providers are additionally defined: 
   - Bank of Slovenia – exotic exchange rates,
   - Croatian national bank – middle exchange rate,
   - National bank of Serbia – middle exchange rate,
   - National bank of the Republic of Macedonia.
 
For the configuration of the National Bank of Serbia, each company needs an individual account in order to be able to use automatic currency exchange import. Mandatory data for the account configuration in the system:
   - License id,
   - Username,
   - Password.
