As part of localization package VAT date is added to some documents (for more details check Localization features) and can be entered manually. With tax package user is able to setup defaulting rules for VAT date calculations. It is possible to set up VAT date and VAT payable date defaulting. Options for defaulting are:
-	None: VAT date has to be entered manually
-	Posting date: VAT date defaults from posting date (field “Date” in journals and FTI, “Invoice date” on Sales invoice)
-	Document date: field “Invoice date” on vendor invoice
-	Document receipt date: applicable only for inbound documents

This additional setup for defaulting VAT dates exists in the parameters of the following modules: General ledger, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.
