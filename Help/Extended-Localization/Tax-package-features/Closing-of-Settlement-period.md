# Close a Settlement period

VAT settlement period can be closed using extended localization feature.  

## Close Period

Field “Closed” is added to Period intervals. If the field is marked, the period is closed for VAT posting. This means that sales tax transactions can’t be posted in that period. 

The field can be un-marked whenever wanted.
