
#Closing of Settlement period

VAT settlement period can be closed using extended localization feature.  

Field “Closed” is added to Period intervals. If field is marked, period is closed for VAT posting. This means that sales tax transactions can’t be posted into that period. Field can be un-marked whenever wanted.
