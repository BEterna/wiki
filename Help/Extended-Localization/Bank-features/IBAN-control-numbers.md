This extended localization feature enables the IBAN control numbers check for Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Standard functionality does not support IBAN check for these three countries, while this feature enables the adequate IBAN validation.

This extended localization feature enables IBAN control number formats, which differ among countries:
-	For Slovenian IBAN control number consists of 2 numbers: SI56XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-	For Croatian IBAN control number consists of 7 numbers: HR12XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-	For Serbian IBAN control number consists of 3 numbers: RS35XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

IBAN entries, not in accordance with the above-described formats in terms of each of the countries will result in an error and are not possible to be saved.
