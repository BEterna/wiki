# Journalize tax as the parent line

This extended localization functionality enables posting tax to the same offset account as the line from which the tax is derived. Journalizing tax as a parent line is available only if posting definitions are enabled. If the “Journalize tax as parent line” option is enabled, tax is always posted with the same offset account as the original line from which the tax is derived.

## **Setup**
---

1. Open General Ledger - Ledger Setup - General Ledger Parameters.
2. Go to Ledger - Set up general information for general ledger.
3. Set field User Posting definition on Accounting Rules to Use.

This setting is relevant only if posting definitions are enabled.

If “Journalize tax as parent line” is enabled, tax is always posted with the same offset account as the original line from which the tax is derived.
