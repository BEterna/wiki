# How To: Create a KEP report

This topic provides country/region-specific information about the locally required KEP report, which is legally required in the retail industry by the Serbian authorities. It uses form prescribed by a rule book in which the entry, exit, and condition of goods in the warehouse need to be financially evidenced. Sources for the report are based on data from calculations, nivelations, invoices, delivery reports, and other documents.

This extended localization feature enables the generation and export of the Serbian legally required report for retail. It includes the KEP report, revelations, and retail calculation. The setup enables the selection of adequate price groups, which should be reported in KEP report. Based on the adequate transactions querying, the KEP report can be created, finalized and printed. The report can be printed in Excel or Word formats.

The feature is part of the LOC_KEP extended localization packet.

2.1	Retail KEP transaction specification
For each transaction shown in the report there are transaction details available in the middle section of the form.
 
3	Report closing
After all errors have been corrected, the report can be finalized and prepared for printing. The closing option closes the report (after report closing, any further changes are not allowed) and all lines get unique line number. In addition, the closing function is also a condition for printing the KEP book.
NOTE: Before generating and closing report for a period, it is necessary to determine whether all inventory transactions have been finalized (whether all vendor invoices are posted, whether all the customer invoices are posted, whether all inventory journals are posted completely) in order to be sure that all transactions that occurred during reporting period are included in the KEP report. Once the report is created, closed and printed, any further changes in inventory can no longer be included in the KEP report.
For start of the closing procedure click Close KEP transactions, on the report header.

 
New form opens. Enter the date by which transactions will be closed. This date should be any day within the period of the KEP book (if it is created during the day, the proposal is to take the previous day as the report closing date).

The print option prints all the lines of the KEP book that are closed (have line number). Printing is started by clicking on the button Print KEP report.
 
Click on OK button and report will be generated.

 
Report can be saved in Excel or PDF format.
 
NOTE: Due to number of transaction included in report, it is recommended to create report for shorter time intervals, and to determine only one (or few) users for creating report in order to avoid the situation of simultaneous generating of report transactions by multiple users at the same time.
