# Registration ID features (SI, HR, RS)

-----

In order to comply with locally used registration IDs (e.g. tax and identification numbers), additional registration categories are added with this localization feature and need to be setup for the adequate Registration IDs to allow other localized features to work correctly - e.g. REK reporting and eInvoices use Registration IDs with the localized registration categories for validation purposes. If inadequate registration categories are used for the set-up of registration IDs, validation when using other localized features may fail, while the required ID may also be missing from other documents, therefore localized registration categories should be used.

Standard functionality of Registration IDs is used for VAT ID, tax identification numbers, Company registration numbers and National identification numbers for Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Users can set up the registration IDs with the localized registration categories for customers, vendors, workers, and legal entities. Localization features are the additionally added registration categories, upon which also locally specific validation of format and structure is enabled.
