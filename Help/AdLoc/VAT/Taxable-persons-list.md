## **Taxable persons list** ##
-----
 
A taxable persons list is added in scope of Slovenian and Croatian localization. Slovenian list stores information, such as: tax registration number, company registration number, taxable person type, name, address and special handling (e.g. 76.a ZDDV-1) checkmark, while Croatian list stores the following information: OIB, identification number, type and name. This list can later be used when adding VAT ID to Vendor or Customer. 

_*List of Taxable persons can also be imported. Import is enabled as part of separate Tax package._
