Bank of Slovenia collects, processes, prepares, communicates to users and publishes data on exchange rates, interest rates, financial intermediaries, international business operations, etc. Among the most important are statistical data. Statistical work is mainly done on three broader areas: statistics of economic relations with the rest of the world, statistics of financial intermediaries and financial accounts statistics. The statistics are intended for internal and external users, among which international institutions stand out as required, as well as domestic and foreign public. Some of the statistical reports are also legally required to be submitted to Bank of Slovenia by legal entities, meeting certain criterion. In the following section, more details about statistical reports, covered by Slovenian localization, can be found.
