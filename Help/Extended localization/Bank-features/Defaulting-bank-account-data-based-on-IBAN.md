Feature allows Bank group and data from Bank group defaulting upon entering IBAN.

This extended localization feature enables additional localization fields “IBAN control number” and “SWIFT code” on bank group form. Entering IBAN on partner, employee or company bank account enables automatic transfer of data from related bank group. After entering IBAN code on bank account, fields Name, Bank groups, SWIFT code, and Address are automatically populated with data from corresponding bank group (if entered in bank group form).
