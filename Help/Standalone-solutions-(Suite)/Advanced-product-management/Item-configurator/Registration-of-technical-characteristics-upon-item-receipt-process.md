Technical characteristics are attributes that are not required for item creation and name building. In the procurement category, they are **marked as Internal**. Their value insertion is possible only upon item registration.

Registration of technical characteristics is **available only for items with batch or/and serial number tracking dimension**. It is performed manually upon product registration for each serial/batch number.

Documents that facilitate the registration of technical characteristics upon receiving and transfer logic:
- **Purchase order product receipt** – registration of internal attribute values upon product registration.
- **Adjustment journal** – registration of internal attribute values upon product registration.
- **Movement journal** – registration of internal attribute values upon product registration.
- **Transfer journal** – transfer of internal attribute values from one serial or batch to another.
- **BOM journal** – registration of internal attribute values is possible with manual input.  
- **Arrival overview** – registration of internal attribute values upon product registration.
