##Subsequently adding new attributes to the procurement category

New attributes can only be added to the procurement category through a **wizard**. Standard button Add in Product attributes tab in Procurement categories form has been replaced by a **new button Add**, enabled by the set up in the Product information management parameters. 

Upon clicking Add, a form opens, where the user first selects desired attributes to add to procurement category. Only attributes that have not previously been added to the procurement category are available for selection. 
 
The next step is specifying the desired parameters for each selected attribute, such as Required for catalog, Position in name, and Internal. To add attribute value to the name of an already existing product, the value of the Position in name field must be higher than the highest number of already existing attributes in the procurement category. 
 
Next, a new window is opened with two sections:
- List of products already associated with procurement category
- List of newly added attributes to procurement category with a field for attribute value insertion 
 
The user specifies the desired values for each attribute. Upon value selection, the names of the products associated with procurement category are updated. The defaulted attribute value is suggested and can be edited for each item. 

When the values are updated, click Finish to complete the process of adding attributes to the procurement category. All the existing items (names and attributes) are updated with selected values. Change in the product name is reflected in the Product name and Search name. Change in the name is reflected only in new documents. Documents that already contain an item that has a changed name will not be updated with the new item name.
