# User enhanced Bank Reconciliation

The solution enables enhanced advanced bank reconciliation. Based on the transactions from the bank statement, processing can be performed (either manually or based on the pre-set processing rules). In contrast to standard D365O reconciliation, this feature enables automatic matching of imported transactions from bank statements with Open customer transactions (inflows) and not yet posted Vendor payment journals (outflows). After matching, transactions can be posted directly from the bank reconciliation processing journal. 

This solution is part of the AdactaSuiteBankStatements AdSuite D365O package.

## **Setup**
---

### Journal names

1. Open **Cash and bank management > Setup > Bank Statements > Journal names**.
2. Set up **bank statement processing journals** and define account types that the bank statement lines can be mapped to.
 
### Unknown inflows

1. Open **Cash and bank management > Setup > Bank Statements > Unknown inflows**.
2. Define **main accounts for unknown inflows and outflows** for each bank account to automatically transfer bank statement line amount – when marked unknown – to this account.
 
### Processing rules

1. Open **Cash and bank management > Setup > Bank Statements > Processing rules**.

Bank statement processing functionality enables automatic reconciliation of data from the electronic bank statement against the transactions in the system, using processing rules.

Steps: 
1. Create a **new processing rule set** and click “**Edit rule set rules**” to define processing rules.
1. Create a **new processing rule**; define its priority (order of execution) and a **type** of rule:
   - **Terminating**: if the transaction meets the criteria of the current matching rule in the processing, it will not be included in the processing of the next rule.
   - **Nonterminating**: if the transaction meets the condition of the current matching rule in the processing, it will nonetheless be included in the processing of the next rule.
5. In the **Match tab**, define criteria by which bank statement lines are filtered. When using regex match type, regex is verified, named capture groups are recognized and saved below as string values.
4. In the **Actions tab**, define the appropriate action (detailed descriptions of each action is found in chapter Action types). Depending on the selected action type, an additional tab is shown where criteria for transaction matching are defined.

 
### Action types

Different action types enable the setup of various processing actions. 


| Action  |  Description |
|---|---|
|Rewrite fields   |This action temporarily changes the value of any field in the bank statement using regex. In the “Field label” field, select the field that needs to be changed. The “Rewrite match” field represents the regex (search condition), the value corresponding to this key is overwritten with “Rewrite output”. The change that happens is not stored in the bank statement, as it is recorded only temporarily; this temporary record is then available for the next action.   |
|Extract variables   |Using this action type, processing can extract a variable from an arbitrary field of the bank statement line in the same way as using regex values.   |
|Ignore   |Depending on the condition defined in the Match tab, a credit/debit ignore line is created with this action.   |
|Mark for confirmation   |If this action type is selected, a checkmark “Confirmation required” is set on the bank statements line after processing, which requires the user to manually confirm the indicated line. It is commonly used in combination with an action where a subsequent review is recommended.   |
|Set context   |This action type creates a context that the following actions can use. It is usually combined with other actions. Contexts can be of different types (Ledger, Vendor, Customer…) and are set from regex values (a variable that can be used in field Context variable) or directly specified with a combination of account type and ledger.   |
|Set context if empty   |Used similarly to action type from chapter Set context. Usually used in combination with other actions. It takes place if the previous action did not produce any matching results.   |
|On account   |This action creates a matching of the bank statement line to the account that is defined by the previous action. It is commonly used in combination with the action Set context.   |
|Match collection letter   |If this action type is included in a rule, processing will check customer collection letter journal transactions, additionally filtered by criteria in the Customer transaction matching tab and settle them upon bank statement posting.   |
|Match customer*/vendor open transactions   |*Match customer open transactions processing rule is discontinued and replaced with the Match customer open transactions V2 rule. Vendor open transactions are matched with bank statement lines according to filters set in transaction matching. “Settle matched transaction” action is needed to settle the transactions against bank statement lines, that have been matched during processing.   |
|Match customer open transactions V2   |A new Matching rule is added in order to enable the matching of open customer transactions according to Dispute status. Consequently, the following fields from CustDispute table are added: Collection status, Note, Last Payment amount  |
|Settle matched customer/vendor transactions   | Bank statement lines that have been matched with the previous action are settled against paired customer or vendor transactions with this action.  |
|Settle matched and other customer/vendor transactions by the due date   |Customer or vendor transactions that have been matched with Match customer/vendor open transactions are settled with the current bank statement line. If the amount on the bank statement line exceeds the matched customer or vendor transaction amount, the amount difference gets settled against other open transactions for that customer/vendor, using sorting by the due date (from oldest to latest). This action can also consume customer/vendor as a context in combination with Match customer/vendor bank account action for example. In that case, the bank statement line gets settled against all open transactions sorted by the due date, as described in the previous paragraph.   |
|Match customer/vendor bank account   |Customer or vendor transactions are filtered according to criteria set in the Customer matching/Vendor matching tab and settled against bank statement lines, corresponding to the following action types. If more partners use the same bank account, a warning is returned after processing.   |
|Match customer/vendor journal lines   |Unposted vendor/customer payment journal lines are matched and settled against bank statement lines according to criteria, defined in Journal matching. Cross currency matching enabled only with this matching rule and only in cases when Enable cross currency matching parameter is enabled.    |
|Match customer/vendor bridged transactions   |Customer/vendor bridged transactions are matched with the bank statement lines according to criteria, defined in Bridged transactions matching.    |
|Match processed bank transactions   |Action is used for matching: <br>(1)	Bank statement lines against already processed bank notification lines <br>(2)	Bank notification lines against already processed bank statement lines     |

 
### Bank account

1. Open **Cash and bank management > Bank accounts > Bank accounts**.
2. On tab Reconciliation, define **processing rules** set for the selected bank account.

### Cross currency matching parameter
With this parameter user can enable matching in cases when original payment document currency and currency, received with bank statement, are different.
1. Go to Cash and bank management > Cash and bank management parameters > Bank statement 
2. Set Enable cross currency matching parameter to yes, to globally enable matching of transaction in different currencies.
3. Select one of options under Vendor payment posting currency parameter, which defines which currency will be used for posting of vendor payment transaction. Available options: 
   - Payment currency: Payments are posted in original payment transaction currency (standard behavior)
   - Coverage/bank statement currency: payments are posted in bank statement currency
 
## **Bank statement/Notifications processing**
---

### **Import and validate bank statement**

Import and validate bank statement in **Cash and bank management > Bank statement reconciliation > Bank statements**.

See documentation: [Detailed documentation](https://ad365o.visualstudio.com/AdLoc/_wiki/wikis/WIPdoc/83/Bank-statement-import?anchor=import-bank-statement)
 
### **Bank statement processing journal**

Open **Cash and bank management > Bank statement reconciliation > Bank statement processing journal**.

Once imported and validated, credit debit notifications and/or bank statement can be reconciled with existing transactions in D365FO. It is also possible to reconcile bank statement lines with already reconciled debit credit bank notification lines and vice versa.

#### Generate debit and credit journal

Debit and credit journal must be generated to process imported debit credit notification and/or bank statement transaction. 

1. Go to  **Cash and bank management > Bank statement reconciliation > Bank statement processing journal**
2. Click **Generate** 
2. Enter following parameters: 
   - **Credit and/or Debit journal names**: Choose form the list of journal names 
   - **Lines** per journal: enter number of lines that will be generated per journal. 
   - **Sources**:  limit transactions to be added to processing journal > **Bank statement** creates only journals with bank statement lines (Journal source = “Statement”), **Bank debit credit notifications** creates only journals with bank notification lines (Journal source = Notification) or **Both**  to create multiple separate journals for both source types (Statement and Notification)
2. Select Additional automation options (optional):    
   - **Validate bank statements and notifications in status “Open”**: if “Yes” Open bank statements/notifications are automatically validated and transferred to processing journal, if existent validation errors are displayed
   - **Process generated journals**: If "Yes", generated processing journal lines will be automatically processed. If set to "No", user needs to run processing manually
   - **Transfer generated journals**: If set to "Yes", processed and successfully matched processing journal lines will be automaticaly transferred to General journal. If set to "No2, user needs to run transfer manually. 

2. Credit and Debit journals are created. Depending on source selection, separate journals are created also for transactions from bank statements (Source: “Statement”) and debit credit notifications (Source: “Notification”). **Open** the desired journal by clicking on **Lines**.

The form is divided into **two tabs**. Information about the bank statement/notification lines is found in tab **Bank statement lines**. Reference number represents payment reference, the Document number is payment ID, Statement ID is Statement ID (or Notification ID if journal source is “Notification”). . Tab **Matching** is divided into two sections: the right part is used for transaction matching (account types that the bank statement lines can be mapped to are defined in journal setup – see chapter Journal names), whereas the left section provides information about the matched transaction.
 
#### Processing 

1. Run **processing** to automatically match bank statement lines with transactions in the system, according to processing rules. 
2. After the processing is completed, message about the matching **results and possible warnings** are displayed.
3. Transactions that match the criteria from processing rules are mapped to adequate bank statement/notification lines. Bank statement/notification lines are **marked as Processed**. The field Ledger account displays the account that the line was mapped to. Bank statement lines that have not been matched and lines that have been matched by a processing rule that has action type “Mark for confirmation” included, are marked as Confirmation required.
4. For line, that has been matched, information about the matched transaction is displayed in tab Matching.
5. If bank statement/notification line is marked as **Unknown**, the matching line is automatically created according to setup in Unknown inflows. Bank statement line needs to be **manually marked as Confirmed**.
 
####  Manual matching

It is possible to **manually match bank statement/notification lines** to desired account types. Depending on setup on processing journal, account types that are available are Vendor, Customer, Bank account, and General ledger, Bridged transactions and Processed bank transactions.

**Vendor/Customer account**
1. **Select** Vendor/Customer account. Open transactions will list below. 
2. If action “Account” is used, the amount from the bank statement/notification line will be posted on a selected vendor/customer account with no link to any transaction. Confirmation is required.
3. It is possible to **mark** the desired transaction from listed open vendor/customer transactions and **match** it with bank statement/notification line. Vendors tab also allows selection of open vendor payment journal lines to be matched with bank statement/transaction lines. Put checkmark in field Marked and click **Transfer**. Marked transaction will be settled against the bank statement/notification line in the amount of the bank statement line. **Confirmation** is required.
3. Additional action **Prepayment** is available on Customers tab. With this bank statement/notification line (inflow) can be marked as prepayment and will be posted according to customer posting profile for prepayments, selected upon Transfer. 

In cases when bank statement transaction currency is different from original vendor payment transaction, such transactions can be matched only if Enable **cross currency matching** parameter is enabled. In this case system takes original vendor payment transaction and changes Currency, amount and calculates cross rate based on both amounts. **Following restrictions apply**: 
- One bank statement line can be matched with only one vendor payment journal line
- Bank statement line amount is the same as matched vendor payment transaction  
- If matched vendor payment transaction settles multiple vendor transactions, the same cross rate is used for all lines. 

**Bank**

4. Bank statement/notification line can be transferred to account type Bank. **Select Bank account** and click **Account** to match bank statement line against a bank account. **Confirmation** is required. 

**General Ledger**

5. Bank statement/notification line transaction can also be settled on main account. In tab **General ledger**, select **main account** and click **Transfer**. Link type General ledger is created. **Confirmation** is required.
 
**Bridged transactions**

Bank statement/notification line transaction can also be settled with an open customer/vendor **bridged transactions**. By clicking “**Transfer**” one bridged transaction can be settled with one bank statement/notification line transaction. Following validation is applied:
   - Bank statement/notification currency must equal the bridged transaction currency (transfer is not possible if the currencies are not equal);
   - Bank statement/notification line transaction amount must match the bridged transaction amount (only a warning is displayed, transfer is completed);
   - Bank statement/notification line transaction amount sign (+/-) must match the bridged transaction sign (transfer is not possible if the signs are not equal);
   - If the selected bridged line is already connected with another bank statement/notification line transaction it cannot be connected to another one.

Similar validation is also applied for other manual matching types. Link type Customer bridged transaction or Vendor bridged transaction is created. Manual confirmation is required.

**Processed bank transactions**

Bank statement (debit credit notification) lines can also be settled with already reconciled bank debit credit notification (bank statement) lines. This can be achieved from “Processed bank transactions” tab. Select adequate transaction from the reconciled notification (statement) and click on transfer. Link type “Processed bank transaction” is created. Confirmation is required. 

In cases when the same notification is received multiple times, it can be marked each time. Marking is done manually.  

 
#### Transfer

Use the Transfer function to transfer processed and confirmed (if confirmation is required) bank statement/notification lines to the general journal for posting. 

_NOTE: if bank statement/notification line is matched with already reconciled bank statement/notification line, no general journal entries are generated._ 

Transfer parameters:


|**Parameter**| **Description** |
|--|--|
|Journal name  |Select journal for bank statement/notification posting  |
|Lines per journal  |Limit the number of lines per one general journal  |
|Process unprocessed  |Run the processing upon transferring  |
|Post journal  |Post the journal upon transferring  |
|Transfer errors  |Works in combination with “Post journal”; during journal posting journal lines that contain errors are transferred into a new journal (works similarly as Post and transfer button in the journal)  |
|Allow duplicates  |Bank statement/notification lines are transferred to the journal even if they have already been transferred to journal previously  |
|Customers-Posting profile |Select customer’s posting profile to post the transferred bank statement/notification lines |
|Customers-Prepayment profile|Select a customer’s posting profile for posting transferred bank statement/notification lines that have been marked as Prepayment. If prepayment profile is left empty, it will be read from setup Accounts receivable > Setup > Accounts receivable parameters > Ledger and sales tax > Payment > Posting profile with prepayment journal voucher. If there is no setup, general posting profile for customers is transferred (Accounts receivable > Setup > Accounts receivable parameters > Ledger and sales tax > General > Posting profile)  |
|Vendors-Posting profile |Select a vendor’s posting profile to post the transferred bank statement lines with|

Upon transferring, **message** with detailed results of transfer action and possible warnings/errors upon validation is displayed. Bank statement/notification lines are updated with journal number and marked as **Transferred**.

Use **View details** to open the journal.
 
Bank statement/notification lines which were matched with open vendor payment journal lines are transferred from vendor payment to a newly created general journal. When all lines from a specific vendor payment journal are transferred, (empty) vendor payment journal is automatically deleted.

For matched open customer/vendor transactions, payment entries are generated in a newly created general journal. 
1. If matching with open **customer/vendor transactions** has been made upon reconciliation, matched open customer/vendor transactions are automatically settled against newly created customer/vendor payment transactions when general journal is posted. 
2. If bank statement/notification lines were only matched with **customer/vendor account** (“Account” action selected with manual matching), settlement is not performed.
3. If bank statement/notification transaction was matched directly with **General ledger account**, upon transfer, new general journal lines against the specified main account are created.
4. In case of the matched customer/vendor **bridged transaction**, same processing as if using standard General journal function “Select bridged transactions” is applied when transferring matching statement/notification lines to general journal.  If upon the transfer a statement/notification line has already been marked for settlement (in another bank statement processing journal), posted, or is no longer existent, transfer results in an error. Transfer also results in an error if the amounts of matched transactions are not equal. Upon the transfer, transaction date of matched bridged transaction is updated with the matched bank statement/notification line date (field “Booking date”). Exchange rate is also updated according to the same booking date from matching statement/notification line. Additionally, bank statement/notification ID and bank statement/notification line transaction description (field “Description”) are transferred to the “Document” and the “Note” fields in the newly created general journal line.
5. If bank statement line is matched with already **reconciled bank notification line**, no general journal entries are created. Upon transfer, matched debit credit notification line in marked as “Reconciled”.
If bank debit credit notification is matched with already reconciled bank statement line, no general journal entries are created. Upon transfer, matched debit credit notification line in marked as “Reconciled with bank statement”.
