Asset insurance is a set of features that enables users to:
- **Register insurance policies** for companyâ€™s assets that can be specified:
  - as actual fixed assets in D365FO Fixed assets module
  - as investment projects (usually future fixed assets for construction in progress) in D365FO Project management and accounting module
  - as user specified general entity, not registered anywhere in D365FO
- **Register loss events** when some damage occurs on company assets (e.g. company vehicle). These loss events are actual events, in which one or more assets are damaged (e.g. a vehicle involved in a car accident, where the accident represents a specific loss event). Loss events are based on Case management in D365FO that use a new (insurance specific) case category type.
