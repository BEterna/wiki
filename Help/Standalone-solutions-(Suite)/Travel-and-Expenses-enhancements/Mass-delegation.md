## **Mass delegation**
---

Standard D365O functionality for delegating is extended with the option to delegate a person for multiple Employees in one step. Mass delegation is enabled for Travel requisitions and Expense reports entry. As an addition to standard delegation option, (person by person) this feature enables a user to enter multiple delegates that belong to one department or Team. User, listed under Delegate, will be authorized to create Expense reports and Travel requisitions for all Employees that belong to Team/Department defined in field Team/Department.

1. Open Expense management/Setup/General/Delegates extended.
2. Mass delegation is enabled for Travel requisitions and Expense reports entry. As an addition to a standard delegation option (person by person), this feature enables a user to enter multiple delegates that belong to one department or Team. 
3. User, listed under Delegate, will be authorized to create Expense reports and Travel requisitions for all Employees that belong to Team/Department defined in field Team/Department. 
4. After setup is done, Update delegates function needs to be run. As a result of this function, lines will be generated in standard Delegate form. At the same time, the recurring batch job is generated, which will update lines in standard Delegate setup according to organizational changes in the related Department/Team. All lines that were generated from extended Delegate form, have a creation method set to Automatic. 
NOTE: Automatically generated records in the Delegate form do not necessarily have the same Start and End date as they are defined in the Delegates extended form due to the fact that last valid time periods of Worker position assignment data are taken into consideration too. However, the Start and End dates from the Delegates extended form can be forced on to the generated records in the Delegates form when the option **Force entered date** is selected.
 
In case that the person that is delegated for other Employees also belongs to Team/Department that is delegated for, an additional line will be generated.
