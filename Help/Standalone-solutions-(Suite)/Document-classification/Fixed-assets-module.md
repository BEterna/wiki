#Tags on documents in Fixed assets module 
---

The following entities facilitate tags functionality:
- Fixed asset
- Fixed asset group 

Tag combination value column, which is available for filtering, is **added to the list pages** of Fixed assets and Fixed asset transcations.

# Tag transfer between documents 
---
Rules for transferring tags in the Fixed assets module are following:
- **Fixed asset group > Fixed asset** â€“ all tags from a fixed asset group are transferred to a fixed asset upon the fixed asset creation and can be modified on Fixed asset. 
- **Fixed asset > Fixed asset transaction** - all tags from a fixed asset are displayed on the fixed asset transaction. 

Changing the tags on fixed asset group does not reflect on already created fixed assets. 

Tag combination value on fixed asset transactions is display value and cannot be edited. Tag combination value on fixed asset transactions is showing the latest tag combination value from fixed asset.
