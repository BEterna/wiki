#Invoicing of flows via Free text invoice

Some companies prefer to send invoices for interest for given loans. In order to use this functionality some additional setup is needed for invoicing categories. Setup is available via menu item **_Loan and deposit management > Setup > Invoicing > Invoicing categories_**

|      Field | Description|
|:----------------|:-------------|
|Invoicing category | Code for invoice category.
|Description  |Short description for the invoice category.
|Billing classification reference ID |If you setup Billing classification it will be used for invoicing. This is optional, however it should be setup if company sets billing classification as mandatory.
|Item sales tax group | Will determine what kind of tax should be calculated on invoice line.
|Invoice text |Text that will be set on invoice line.
 
Second part of setup is in menu item: **_Loan and deposit management > Setup > Loans > Flow categories_**, where for the Offset account type Customer invoice must be selected and Invoicing Category needed for billing.

After the flows are calculated, user can create interest invoices via menu item **_Loan and deposit management > Periodic > Loans > Create invoices - credit lines_**. This will create Free text invoices, which can be posted as any other FTI.

Note:
When preparing invoices kindly note that Accounts receivable default posting profile is used, setup in **_Accounts receivable > Setup > Accounts receivables parameters_** (Ledger and sales tax, Posting profile).
