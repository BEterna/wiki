Throughout the following sections of this document, functionalities and forms connected with different project invoice procedures will be presented.

Following enhancements are available:
- Settle open transactions on project invoice proposal

Settle open transactions on project invoice proposal

The functionality »Settle open transactions« is developed for the purpose of automatically closing open transactions with specific customer. The open transactions of the customer which are marked on the Invoice proposal are automatically closed when it is posted. This is also helpful in situation when we want to check whether we have any prepayments paid by the customer or when it comes to the loan.
There is no specific setup needed for using the functionality.
Steps:
1.	Go to Project management and accounting module > Project invoices > Project invoice proposals.
2.	Mark or open the specific invoice proposal and in Action Pane click Settle open transactions.
3.	A new window with open transactions will open. Mark transactions that you want to be settled.
4.	Check the transactions and click OK.
5.	After the invoice has been reviewed, post the Invoice proposal.
6.	All marked transactions are settled with the invoice.
