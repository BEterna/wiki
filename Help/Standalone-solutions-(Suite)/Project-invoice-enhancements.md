# Project invoice enhancements

Throughout the following sections of this document, functionalities and forms connected with different project invoice procedures will be presented.

Following enhancements are available:
- Settle open transactions on project invoice proposal
- Overview of prepayment amount on project invoice proposal

### Settle open transactions on project invoice proposal
---
The functionality **Settle open transactions** is developed for the purpose of automatically closing open transactions with specific customer. The open transactions of the customer which are marked on the Invoice proposal are automatically closed when it is posted. This is also helpful in situation when we want to check whether we have any prepayments paid by the customer or when it comes to the loan.

There is no specific setup needed for using the functionality.

Steps:
- Go to Project management and accounting module > Project invoices > Project invoice proposals.
- Mark or open the specific invoice proposal and in Action Pane click Settle open transactions.
- A new window with open transactions will open. Mark transactions that you want to be settled.
- Check the transactions and click OK.
- After the invoice has been reviewed, post the Invoice proposal.
- All marked transactions are settled with the invoice.

### Overview of prepayment amount on project invoice proposal
---
When user creates a project invoice proposal and selects an advance payment in the settlement of open transaction process, the prepayment amount can be checked on the Totals form of the project invoice proposal.

When the final (original) invoice is posted, VAT amount from the advanced invoice that is settled with the project invoice is automatically reversed and VAT of the final (original) invoice is posted. If only a partial amount of prepayment is applied, a proportional share of the Advance invoice will be reversed.
