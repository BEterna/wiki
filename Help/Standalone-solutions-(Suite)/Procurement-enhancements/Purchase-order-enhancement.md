## Purchase order enhancement

### Assign subcontractor 
---

In standard D365FO, when a purchase order is related to a purchase agreement that has subcontractors, it is not possible to change the vendor account to one of the subcontractors without removing the link to the agreement. Consequently, it is not possible to track agreement fulfillment that would include subcontractors.
 
A new feature “Assign subcontractor” has been added to the purchase order that allows the change of vendor account without removing the link to purchase agreement. Available vendors for selection are the subcontractors from the related purchase agreement.
 
After the subcontractor is assigned (vendor account is changed), the purchase agreement link remains.
