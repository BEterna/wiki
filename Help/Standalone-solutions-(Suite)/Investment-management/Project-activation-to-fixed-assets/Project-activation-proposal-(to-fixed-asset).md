The Project activation proposal document is used for distribution of open project transactions to new or existing fixed assets. It replaces standard elimination from project to a single fixed asset.

First step is creating new proposal and defining data in header (Project Id and date of FA activation). Afterwards, project transactions have to be added to a proposal and fixed assets can be selected or created out of the same document. The next step is distribution of project transactions to one or more fixed assets. After distribution, document can be sent to workflow (if required) and it can be posted after approval in WF has been completed. Posting transfers transactions from WIP (work in progress) accounts to fixed asset accounts via dispersal account. After posting, distributed project transactions can be added to new project proposal only, if there is still remaining amount for elimination.
