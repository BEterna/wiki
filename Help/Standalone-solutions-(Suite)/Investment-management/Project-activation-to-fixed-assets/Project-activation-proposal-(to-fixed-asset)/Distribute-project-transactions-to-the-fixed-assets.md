When fixed assets and project transactions are added to the project activation proposal, the next step is to distribute transactions amounts to fixed assets. Firstly, select fixed assets and transactions that need to be distributed (not all fixed assets and transactions from the proposal have to be chosen, therefore select only transactions and fixed assets that have to be activated) and then click the Distribute button.

After clicking the Distribute button, new pop-up windows with project transactions and fixed assets appear. In order to calculate the Distributed amount, weight for each fixed asset must be entered. Note that the Distributed amount is calculated based on the following formula:

$Distributed Amount Of FA = SUM of Undistributed Amounts Of Transactions * \frac{Weight Of FA}{SUM of All Weights}$

After entering the desired weights, press the Distribute by weight button, check the distributed amount for each fixed asset and then press the OK button.

After this step, you can switch from Header to Specification tab in the proposal to review distributions. Table shows all distributed combinations of transactions and fixed assets, as well as the distributed amount for each combination. In this table, distributed amounts can be changed manually for each transaction-fixed asset combination. These distributions can be also opened in Excel, where you can define actual distributed amounts and import them back to the system.
