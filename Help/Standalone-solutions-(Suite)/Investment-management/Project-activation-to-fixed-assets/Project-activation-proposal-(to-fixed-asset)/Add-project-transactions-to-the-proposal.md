In the list of added project transactions, there are columns available, where you can see open amount of project transaction for distribution to fixed asset:
- 	Distributed amount: this column represents amount of the transaction that has been already distributed but not yet activated (e.g. in other project activation proposals)
- 	Activated amount: it represents the amount of the transaction that has been activated to fixed asset in another posted Project activation proposal
- 	Remains amount: available amount for distribution in current proposal.
- 	Remains amount = Total cost amount â€“ (Distributed amount + Activated amount)
- 	Total cost amount: amount of the whole project transaction.

The same inquiry of all non-activated transactions for all projects is available in _Project management and accounting > Transactions > Project activation transactions to fixed asset_.
