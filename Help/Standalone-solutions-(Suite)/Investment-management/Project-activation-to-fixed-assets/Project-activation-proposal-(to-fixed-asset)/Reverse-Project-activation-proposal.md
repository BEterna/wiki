After the proposal is posted, it can be reversed. Press the button Reversal. You can review posted voucher transactions by clicking the Voucher transactions button.

Once the proposal is reversed, it cannot be reverted to draft. A new proposal has to be created.

Note that proposal, which created a new fixed asset and posted a transaction with the type Acquisition, cannot be reversed after posting additional transactions with the same transaction date or later on the fixed asset. In order to reverse the proposal, all other transactions must be reversed prior to the proposal reversal.

A proposal, which posted Write Up Adjustment transaction on already acquired fixed asset, can be reversed after posting additional transactions with the same transaction date or later on the fixed asset, after confirming the pop-up message below.
