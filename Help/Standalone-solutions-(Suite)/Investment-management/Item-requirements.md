Item requirements for a project are used for items that are not necessarily consumed immediately. An item requirement is a **demand of items for a project from the company's own inventory**. Users (e.g. project members) can order items for consumption on a project (i.e. items that must be built into a future asset) from the company's inventory or they can purchase items from a vendor, if no stock is available for a project item requirement. With standard functionalities, users cannot track items that were issued from a warehouse and are not yet consumed on a project (e.g. items are located on a project terrain). With Investment management package, the new [**Project allocation**](/Help/Standalone-solutions-\(Suite\)/Investment-management/Project-allocation) tracking dimension is available for this purpose.

An overall process of item consumption on a project would go like displayed in the image below:

With Investment management package, process of item procurement and consumption can be more automated.  Items differ and can be consequently treated in different ways for project consumption. 
- **Consumables** (e.g. screws): such items do not require the Project allocation (PA) tracking dimension because they are usually consumed for different projects and are not reserved in stock for a particular project. These items are usually available in stock in main warehouse and can be consumed from a moving warehouse (e.g. truck). When a truck driver comes to pick up consumables from main warehouse, he will transfer these items as needed on different locations per each project. With Investment management package, such items do not require item requirements, instead users can create transfer order (TO) from main warehouse to a moving warehouse and a project member can post item consumption on project via project item journal when consumables are actually consumed on a project.
- **Items with the PA tracking dimensions** (e.g. transformers, cables, pipes): such items require the PA tracking dimension and item requirements. Such items can be:
   - Consumed immediately on a project when storekeeper gives items out of a warehouse to a project member.
   - Transferred to a terrain location of a project when storekeeper gives items out of a warehouse and are consumed from terrain on a project when project member decides. If integration is needed with external system, consumption of items on a project can be also sent via API integration.

(Non)direct consumption of items is specified based on differentiation between warehouses on item requirement:
- If **consumption (terrain) warehouse and receiving (default) warehouse differ** and consumption warehouse is defined as terrain warehouse, system will automatically create transfer order from receiving to consumption warehouse. If no item is available in stock, system will create planned purchase order for receiving warehouse, only if master planning module is in use, otherwise users should manually create purchase orders. Picking and registration of items in receiving warehouse is done automatically out of the transfer order document. Storekeeper will post shipment of items (in stock) when he will issue items from receiving warehouse on request of a project member. Receipt of items on terrain warehouse happens at the same time as shipment is posted. With this same action of posting shipment for TO, items are also picked on a terrain location directly from IR. In this way, items on a terrain are reserved for a particular project (and project item requirement). When items are spent on a project, a project member manually posts consumption on a project for selected item requirements. With this step completed, project transaction is generated.
- If **consumption and receiving warehouse is the same**, no transfer order is generated, and system will automatically create picking and registration of items in receiving warehouse. As soon as storekeeper gives items to a project team member, he posts such shipment and with the posting action also consumption to a project happens (i.e. posting of packing slip for IR). With this step completed, project transaction is generated.

For this purpose, new functionalities are available with the Investment management package:
- Ability to **track inventory for a particular project** with the Project allocation tracking dimension. 
- Ability to define and recognize warehouses that represent a construction site of a project (**Terrain warehouses**).
- Ability to define and recognize warehouses that represent vehicles used for transporting materials and consumables (**Moving warehouses**).
- Ability to differentiate direct item consumption from non-direct item consumption:
   - **Direct consumption**: when an item is shipped from a classic (default) warehouse, it is immediately consumed on a project
   - **Non-direct consumption**: when an item is shipped from a classic (default) warehouse to a terrain warehouse, it is treated as inventory on the terrain warehouse (i.e. construction site) until project consumption is triggered (i.e. item has been built into a future asset)
 - Ability to **automate inventory reservations and shipments** for direct and non-direct item requirements.
