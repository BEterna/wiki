The purpose of the Investment management Project activation proposal functionality is to simplify elimination of selected project transactions to various fixed assets. The Project activation proposal to fixed asset functionality was developed to overcome some disadvantages of the project elimination to fixed asset standard functionality. 

**Advantages** of the IM project activation proposal comparing to standard functionality for project elimination are following:
- More than one FA can be capitalized per project
- Project does not have to be fully completed in order to capitalize it partially
- Write-up adjustments are posted automatically
- Forecast model is not necessary to transfer project WIP (work in progress) costs to FA
- User does not have to create fixed assets before capitalizing project costs to FA.
