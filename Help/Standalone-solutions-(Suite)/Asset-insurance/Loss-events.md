# Setup
---
Prior to creating a loss event, the setup described below is required.

## Case categories
Case categories for loss events are configured in the Organization administration module, **Organization administration > Setup > Cases > Case categories**. In the Case categories setup, a new case category with type Loss event is needed. Such case categories can be used on loss events. Each case category can be linked with case process. 

## Case processes

Case processes for loss events are configured in Organization administration module, **Organization administration > Setup > Cases > Case processes**. Case processes is standard D365FO functionality, which is used also for loss events. Case processes enable monitoring different stages throughout the loss event.

1. **Add code lists** for Closure reasons.

# Creating a loss event

## Loss event statuses and stages

Loss event functionality uses standard case statuses and case stages functionalities.

Loss event can be in one of 4 following statuses:
- **Opened**
- **In process**
- **Closed**
- **Cancelled**

In addition to statuses, stages of loss event can be also monitored. List of stages depends on the selected Case process. 

The **Case process** button enables editing the case process that is selected on the loss event. The **Change stage** button enables moving from one stage to another in the case process. To start a next stage and complete the previous one, mark the first case in the list with the status Not started and click the button OK.

Although it does not influence entering data in any field, tracking stages of the loss event can be helpful with loss events that last over some period. Whenever a user reopens the loss event, it can be easily checked in which stage is the loss event.

## Details view

When a new case is created (or an already created one is opened), Details view is opened, where all the information about the loss event can be found. 

**General** and **Loss event** fast tabs contain:
- Information added throughout the pop-up panes **General**, **Loss event** and **Other** 
- Additional standard case follow-up fields, such as Email ID, Contact ID, etc.
- **Billing project** (General fast tab) â€“ if a project will be used for the purpose of posting project transactions related to remediating the damage in order to track costs, that project can be linked to a loss event by selecting it in the Billing project field. 
- **Invoice amount** (General fast tab) â€“ shows the sum of all vendor invoices linked to the loss event in Associations fast tab.

The **Insurance coverage** fast tab enables adding insurance entities that are included/damaged/injured in loss event. The selection is limited to insurance entities that were added on insurance policy, which is selected in the loss event.
