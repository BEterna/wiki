# Dunning

The package covers two important dunning processes. First is automated generation of collections cases and the other are enforcements, that cover the judicial dunning procedure including communication with court. 
With collections cases users can follow activities that have been performed by collections agents internally in order to collect open receivables. As part of this package, mass generation of collections cases has been enabled. 
Second functionality covers judicial dunning procedure. Collections cases can represent input for enforcements, but enforcements can also be used independently.  Enforcements represent second step of dunning process and are used when internal collection process does not result in collected receivables, so they need to be collected through court. 

The process is presented in the following steps:
- [Basic setup](/Help/Standalone-solutions-\(Suite\)/Dunning-process/Basic-setup)
- [Enforcement](/Help/Standalone-solutions-\(Suite\)/Dunning-process/Enforcements)
- [Judicial dunning procedure](/Help/Extended-Localization/Judicial-dunning-procedure-\(SI\)) (Depends on BE-terna Adriatic Localization (SI))
