# Public Procurement

Public procurement is a set of actions, with the objective of purchasing goods, services or contractual works in a more economical way. In some countries, the use of prescribed public procurement procedures is often mandatory, especially for direct or indirect users of national and local budgets. Regardless of the type and extent of the order, these entities must respect the fundamental principles of public procurement, such as the economic use of public funds, the equity of providers, the transparency of the procedures, and the principle of ensuring competition between the tenderers. All public procurement contracts have to be in accordance with these principles, therefore this functionality enhances and adds to the standard D365O functionality for the purpose of simple, efficient and legally correct public procurement in the following areas:

- The ability to include multiple requests for quotations in one public procurement case.
- Configurable public procurement procedures within the D365FO with necessary steps and amount limits for each procedure.
- The ability to record legal protection events and activities related to outcomes of assessment of the relevance of each occurrence.
