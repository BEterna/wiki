Bank of Slovenia collects, processes, prepares, communicates to users and publishes data on exchange rates, interest rates, financial intermediaries, international business operations, etc. Among the most important are statistical data. 

Statistical work is mainly done on three broader areas: statistics of economic relations with the rest of the world, statistics of financial intermediaries and financial accounts statistics. The statistics are intended for internal and external users, among which international institutions stand out as required, as well as the domestic and foreign public. Some of the statistical reports are also legally required to be submitted to Bank of Slovenia by legal entities, meeting certain criteria. In the following section, more details about statistical reports, covered by Slovenian localization, can be found. 

## **BST Report** ##
-----
BST report on transactions by residents with non-residents for services and part of a trade, and given or received capital transfers is a monthly report on purchases/sales and capital transfers between residents and non-residents. Legal entities obliged to report are informed about their obligations by the Bank of Slovenian based on the importance of their business activities with the non-residents. The report is based on transactions from the sent and received invoices. Credit notes are reported as corrections for the original period of the invoice. If obliged to report, legal entities must submit the report until the 20th day in the current month for the past month, electronically in an adequate XML format. This localization feature enables the preparation and export of the report in the TXT file format based on the pre-set BST reporting codes for transactions with non-residents, with which legal entity has been involved throughout the reporting period.

SFR (Statistics of financial accounts) is used for quarterly reporting of statistical financial accounts to Bank of Slovenia. Legal entities, obliged to reporting, are defined based on multiple criteria, defined in the Decision on reporting of data for the purpose of statistics on financial accounts, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, no. 106/2013. The report must include information about the balance of assets and liabilities on the financial accounts and information about the transactions and changes in the valuation of the financial assets and liabilities.

The report can be generated, reviewed and exported in an adequate XML format, accepted by the Bank of Slovenia.
