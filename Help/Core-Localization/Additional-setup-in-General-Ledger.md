# How To: Set additional setup in General Ledger

## Setup

Setup is added to General ledger parameters as part of extended Adacta localization.

1. Open General Ledger/Ledger Setup/General Ledger parameters -> Journalizing Adacta.
   - Set field Journal tax as parent
2. Journalize tax as parent line:
   - Use posting definitions: this setting is relevant only if posting definitions are enabled. 

## Posting

If “Journalize tax as parent line” is enabled, tax is always posted with the same offset account as the original line from which the tax is derived.
