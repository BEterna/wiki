# Intrastat enhancements

Intrastat is the system for collecting information and generating statistics about the trade of goods among countries/regions of the European Union (EU). Intrastat reporting is required whenever a product crosses the border of another EU country/region, whereas, in several countries/regions, Intrastat reporting also applies to services. Mandatory and optional elements can be collected in Intrastat reporting. Most of the Intrastat functionality consists of standard D365 features. Some features, however, are added in order to comply with the requirements of the Slovenian and Croatian local authorities. These localized enhancements are described in the following section.



###**Exchange rate**

 
In Croatia it is legally required to report foreign currency transactions converted into Croatian local currency (HRK), using the first valid exchange rate of Croatian national bank for the month in which Intrastat is required to be reported. This localization feature allows users to specify the adequate Exchange rate type in order to include the exchange rate calculation. When transferring transactions in foreign currency (other than HRK) to Intrastat journal, values are recalculated to accounting currency, using the specified Intrastat exchange rate.
ELECTRONIC REPORTING FORMATS Localization provides adequate Intrastat report file mappings (for Slovenia and Croatia), which enable users to generate Intrastat reports in accordance with the Slovenian and Croatian legislation, whereas the reporting format is standard.


### **Intrastat journal line status**

Another localized feature is the line status of transactions included in the Intrastat journal. With the localization added status allows lines in Intrastat journal to be available for editing until line status remains “Open”. Additionally, transactions can be filtered based on this status.


### **Reporting history**

The feature enables reviewing historically created Intrastat declaration (and in these declarations included transactions). Additionally, it enables a generation of replacement declarations regarding past reporting periods, for which Intrastat declarations have already been submitted. Status of the reported transactions can be set back to “Open”, and then replacement declaration can be created for each of the reports from reporting history. This can be useful if changes have been made in connection with transactions, which have already been declared through Intrastat. In this case, replacement declarations can be created, with the updated transactions reporting period.


### **Intrastat archive**

Enables users to review transactions, which have been compressed by parameters (compression is a standard feature, while the review of compressed transactions is localized feature). Localization functionality also ads option to transfer the compressed transactions back to the Intrastat journal in their original state (before compression) when applicable.

### **Weight change on product receipt**
Information about weight can be manually changed on product receipt line. 

### **Statistical adjustment value according to delivery terms** 
With additional setup on Delivery terms, statistical value adjustment can be calculated. Different setup can be applied to each delivery term. 


## **Setup**
---

### Transaction codes

1. Open Tax – Setup – Foreign trade – Transaction codes.

   - Total cost – The amount will be equal to the total cost of the transaction.
   - Manual – The amount will be equal to the amount that is manually specified on the transfer order line.
4. For sales orders and purchase orders, you set up one of the following rules for calculating invoice amounts and statistical amounts:
   - Empty – The amount will be 0 (zero).
   - Invoice amount – The amount will be equal to the amount that is invoiced for the commodity.

Localization allows lines in the Intrastat journal to be filtered by reporting status (LOC).
 
#### Reporting history

Another localization feature in the Intrastat journal is “Reporting history” (LOC).
 
1. Here, information about past reporting is available. It is possible to change the status of reported transactions back to “Open” using the button “Open reported transactions”.
