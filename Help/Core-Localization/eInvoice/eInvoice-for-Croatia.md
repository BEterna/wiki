# eInvoices for Croatia 

The purpose of this feature is to enable the Invoice export in the prescribed electronic form (UBL 2.1 standard). The export file can be generated for multiple invoices. Web service communication is not part of this feature. 

## **Setup**
---

### **Export format configuration**

Configuration for export of invoices according to the UBL 2.1 standard is available. In the case of standard changes, the configuration needs to be adjusted. 

1. Open **Workspaces > Electronic reporting > Reporting configurations**.
2. Choose Exchange -> Load XML file on any configuration. Based on file content it will automatically upload to correct configuration.
3. Before upload, check the latest version of these files with the developer. 
Click “Browse” and choose the configuration files (be sure to upload the “Customer invoice model AdLoc“ first because the following ones are dependent on it). After the file has loaded, click OK to upload it to configuration.
4. First, search for configuration “Customer invoice model” and expand it to find “Customer invoice model AdLoc “. Import the latest configuration. When done, “Customer invoice model mapping AdLoc” imports automatically. All the remaining configurations need to be imported in the following order:
   - Project Credit Note HR,
   - Project invoice HR,
   - Sales Credit Note HR,
   - Sales invoice HR.
  
### **Electronic invoice parameters**

1. Open **Accounts receivable > Setup > Croatia > E-Invoices > Electronic invoice parameters**.
2. General eInvoice parameters are set up under tab “General”, such as:
   - **Automatic sending of eInvoices**: enable to automatically download eInvoice after XML is created
   - **Default unit of measure**: Default unit of measure for eInvoice if value is empty on source entity 
   - **Download eInvoice as archive**: with this function ZIP file will be generated with eInvoice files (invoice and customized visualization). Important: visualization of the document is not part of this localized feature and needs to be implemented during project implementation).
   - **Memorandum information**
   - **Signature options** (Not yet supported for Croatian localization)
3. In the “Profile” section create Profile ID and choose adequate Electronic reporting configurations:

---

### Electronic customer invoices

1. Open Accounts receivable – Invoices – E-Invoices – Electronic customer invoices.
2. Posting sales or free text invoices for customers with Profile ID automatically generates eInvoice. 
3. Created eInvoice can be found in customer eInvoices registry with status “New”. 
4. Create an XML function that creates the XML version of the invoice. No validation of the information from the customer/invoice is currently supported in terms of Croatian localization.
The XML file is created and stored in the field “Outgoing XML” in the Details tab. Here, more information about eInvoice is displayed, including a unique file name, details about the user and created date.
5. Status is changed to “Created”. eInvoice unique file name is generated as defined in the number sequence.
6. After XML has been created, the button “Send” is enabled. By clicking the button, eInvoice status changes to “Sent”. An XML version of the eInvoice is downloaded at the same time.
7. Multiple selections are also enabled for actions. Mark the eInvoices with a checkmark and select appropriate action (Create XML, Send).
 
Manually changing status to higher status is not allowed.
 
The following functions are available:
   - “Export” - XML version of eInvoice is exported (eInvoice status remains unchanged) and
   - “Send” (if function “Download eInvoice as an archive in Electronic invoice parameters is enabled), a ZIP file containing the XML version of the eInvoice is downloaded. eInvoice status changes to “Sent”.
 
Export of eInvoice before the creation of XML (e.g. status “New” or “Not ready”) is not allowed.
 

 
### Electronic project invoices

1. Open Accounts receivable – Invoices – E-Invoices – Electronic project invoices.
2. Posting invoice proposal for customers with Profile ID automatically generates eInvoice.
3. Created eInvoice can be found in the project eInvoices registry with status “New”. 

Project eInvoices are subject to the same procedures and actions as FTIs or Sales invoices.

### Subsequent creation of eInvoices

1. Open Accounts receivable – Invoices – E-Invoices – Electronic customer/project invoices  button “Select”.
2. EInvoices can be subsequently generated according to selected filters for already posted invoices or invoices deleted from eInvoice registry for the customer with adequate Profile ID. Navigate to button “Select” and define Criteria for the subsequent creation of eInvoices. 
3. After confirming, subsequent eInvoices are created with status “Not ready”.
