# Prepare REK-2 report

REK-2 is a Slovenian personal tax report, which taxpayers are legally (ZDoh-2) obliged to report to the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) if they pay income, other than income from the employment. A taxpayer may also authorize another person to calculate and pay tax on his behalf. The data shall be reported to the tax authority (FURS) by all taxpayers when the payment of other income according to ZDoh-2 (excluding income from employment), from which the tax, the withholding tax, and social security contributions are paid:
-	income from another contractual relationship,
-	income from activities,
-	income from letting out property,
-	income from transfer of property right,
-	other income (Article 104 ZDoh-2),
-	interest and dividends.

In terms of this localization feature, REK-2 report generation is enabled for Slovenian legal entities. Transaction amounts, required to be reported with REK-2 are calculated using vendor invoices and tax codes with separate Settlement period types. Reports can be generated at the time when adequate transactions are added to the payment journal. REK-2 report can be previewed (HTML) and exported in the XML format, structured in a way to comply with the requirements of the Slovenian tax authority (FURS).

Additionally, this localization feature enables Slovenian legal entities to create Notices of payment for paid and not yet paid contractual work and Summary statements of income. Summary statement of income for each customer (contractor) can be generated after income payments have been posted. Thus, both documents are used to inform the payees (contractors) about the income, taxes, and payment of contributions. Additionally, both – Notice of payment and Summary statement of income can be exported to various formats (e.g. Word or PDF).

## **Setup**
---

### General ledger parameters

1. Open General ledger – Ledger setup – General ledger parameters.
2. To be able to preview and export the REK-2 report, it is necessary to select the “REK-2 electronic reporting format”.
 
### Income types and income tax income types

1. Open Tax – Setup – Adriatic – Personal tax – Income types.
2. It is necessary to set up REK income types for reporting purposes. Using the button “New” entry with income type and description is created.
3. Open Tax – Setup – Adriatic – Personal tax – Income tax income types.
4. Using the button “New” entry with income tax income type and description is created.
 
### Sales tax authorities

1. Open Tax – Indirect taxes – Sales tax – Sales tax authorities.
2. Additional tax authority needs to be created for purposes of REK-2 functionality. In the field “Vendor account” vendor FURS is chosen (vendor who the entries for personal tax payments in vendor payment journal and liabilities for payments will be created). Value in field “Report layout” has to be “Default” since REK-2 entries are not reported in VAT books).

### Sales tax settlement periods

1. Open Tax – Indirect taxes – Sales tax – Sales tax settlement periods.
2. The new sales tax settlement period has to be created for REK-2 purposes.
3. The tax authority, created earlier, has to be selected in the field “Authority”. We will be using the “Monthly” period interval unit with interval duration “1”. Since the same functionality is being used for VAT and REK-2, it is necessary to define Period type value as “REK-2”. This setup enables that upon closing the period only entries for REK-2 will be considered in the calculation (period type “REK-2” prevents the generation of DDV-O report and settlement of VAT entries).
4. Set **Post personal tax without VAT date** to **Yes** to enable posting of REK-2 tax transactions without VAT date. In this case VAT date will be populated automatically with payment date when payment journal is posted.  
5. Set **Period type** to **Personal tax**

### Ledger posting groups

1. Open Tax – Setup – Sales tax – Ledger posting groups.
2. The new ledger posting group is opened for ledger posting (main account defined in field “Sales tax receivable”). According to our business practice, we open as many ledger posting groups as there are different ledger accounts we want to post liabilities to.
 
There is no need to set up a Settlement account since closing the period will post REK-2 entries to the vendor, defined as tax authority on sales tax settlement period for REK-2. 

### Sales tax codes

1. Open Tax – Indirect taxes – Sales tax – Sales tax codes.
2. REK income type is defined on sales tax code. For every income type there are individual sales tax codes for deductions and contributions:
   - Income tax
   - Each of the contributions to gross
   - Each of the deductions from gross 
3. Under General, settlement period and ledger posting group, created for REK-2 purposes, and currency are defined. 
4. Sales tax codes are created for deductions, calculated from gross amount, as well as for contributions to gross. For correct calculation of deductions from gross the functionality of negative tax is used on those sales tax codes that define deductions from gross. Enabling field “Allow negative sales tax percentage” allows the entry of negative sales tax code value. Bellow, there is an example for entering “PIZ iz bruta” setup of 15.5%. 
5. Sales tax code percentage is entered in form Value.

When entering the value for income tax it is important to enter also potential personal exemption, tax allowances, and contributions that reduce the basis for calculation.  There are additional fields in form Value (“Personal tax” part) that are considered for the calculation for income tax percentage.  
 
“Personal tax” part: field Value should be entered in negative amount for income tax; fields Personal exemption, Tax allowances (10%), and Contributions (PIZ (15,5%) + ZZ (6,36%) is 21,86%) are populated with adequate percentages. The percentage of sales tax code value is automatically updated after entering. 

Contributions to the gross increase in total employer cost. For each of the contributions to gross it is, therefore, necessary to create two sales tax codes – one with a positive value and 100% non-deductible (result is posting on cost account), the other with a negative value and 0% non-deductible (result is posting on liabilities account for withholding tax). 
 
#### Setup for REK-2 reporting

There are fields in Adacta localization part on sales tax codes that need to be correctly populated in order for REK-2 reporting to work.
   - Personal tax reporting: REK-2
   - Income type: chosen from Tax – Setup – Adriatic – Personal tax – Income types
   - In case of sales tax code for income tax, fields Deduction type and Contribution type are populated with “None”, field Tax income type has to have a value from Tax – Setup – Adriatic – Personal tax – Income tax income types (same as in the picture above)
   - Deduction type: in case of entry paid by employee (deduction from gross), one of the following values has to be chosen: PIZ, ZZ, Parental care, Employment; field “Tax income type” has to be empty.
   - Contribution type: in case of entry paid by employer, it is necessary to choose one of the following options in this field: PIZ, ZZ, Parental care, Employment, Work injuries, Special tax, Contingent or temporary work levy. Same reporting setup needs to be done on both sales tax codes – positive and negative one.
   - Tax income type: in case of income tax entry, value is chosen from Tax – Setup – Adriatic – Personal tax – Income tax income types.
  
#### Reliefs and certificates

If payment is done to contractors who exercise certain reliefs on income tax it is necessary to create additional sales tax codes with the appropriate settings. Recommended is to create new procurement categories for income types with relief and define new item sales tax groups (procurement category is then chosen on the purchase order/vendor invoice for the contractors that exercises a certain relief). It is also possible to create new sales tax groups and allocate them to respective vendors. 

Adacta localization tab on sales tax code allows “Benefit type” and “Required certificate” to be chosen in section Reporting. Choosing a certain relief does not automatically affect the calculation – it is necessary to manually enter the appropriate value (e.g. if relief for cultural workers is selected on sales tax code, it is necessary to enter the appropriate percentage of relief to Values; sole indication that it is a relief for cultural workers does not affect the amount).

For this purpose, new fields are added to sales tax codes, Adacta localization. It is possible to choose among the following relief options:
   - DTC reduced tax: enable if income tax is subjected to tax reduction under double taxation convention. 
      - Required certificate: choose certificate type, in case that is needed to exercise tax reduction (individual certificates are entered on vendor card – more in Chapter Vendor certifications) 
 
Certification types are entered in Procurement and sourcing – Setup – Vendors – Certification type.
 
The certificate number that is entered on vendor card, and the corresponding percentage of the personal income tax rate, which is entered in sales tax code value, are recorded in field D11 of the REK report.
   - Withholding rate deduction: enable if income tax is subjected to reduced deductions.
 
Fields 110 and 203 of the REK-2 report are populated with information about tax base amount and reduced deduction amount.
   - Additional tax reduction (cultural workers): checkmark to determine whether the income is subject to additional relief for the self-employed in culture (the gross amount is recorded in field 102 of REK-2 report)
 
#### Benefits

“Benefit type” field is added to the Sales tax code tab Adacta localization. Options to select are Personal vehicle, Accommodation, Insurance premium, and Other.
 
Test case presented in chapter Benefits.

#####	Payment setup

Payment section of the Adacta localization tab on sales tax codes enables entry of payment data, such as Vendor account (Slovenian tax authority FURS, in our case), Bank account to which the payment of personal tax will be executed, Payment ID, and Central bank purpose code. Entered data are transferred to the vendor journal payment line using the Payment proposal.
 
### Sales tax groups

1. Open Tax – Indirect taxes – Sales tax – Sales tax groups.
2. Add adequate sales tax codes to sales tax groups.
 
### Item sales tax groups

1. Open Tax – Indirect taxes – Sales tax – Item sales tax groups.
2. Create item sales tax group for each REK income type and add adequate sales tax codes. 
 
### Procurement categories

1. Open Procurement and sourcing – Procurement categories.
2. Create a procurement category for each income type and define the Item sales tax group. 
3. Procurement categories need an adequate ledger account for posting – this setup is done in Inventory management – Setup – Posting – Posting. 
 
If the cost of contract work is posted via the vendor invoice, the ledger account setup is done under “Purchase expenditure for expense” transaction type. In case product receipts are used, posting setup also needs to be done in the “Purchase expenditure, un-invoiced” section.

### Vendor certifications

1. Certificates regarding reliefs or international conventions are entered on vendor card -> button Certifications. 
2. Mandatory fields to enter are: 
   - Certification type and Certification number,
   - Certifying organizations (e.g. Slovenian tax authority or Ministry for culture),
   - Certification date. 
3. If Certification type is chosen on sales tax code and a certificate for the same certification type is entered on the vendor, then the certificate number is recorded in REK-2 field D11. 
 
## **Purchase order and/or Vendor invoice**
---

1. Contract work is entered on the separate Purchase order/Vendor invoice for each contractor (vendor) by choosing an adequate procurement category in the document line (in case of using price lists, service item should be used). Entering multiple income types on one source document (multiple procurement categories on the purchase order/vendor invoice) is also supported. Gross amounts are entered on the purchase line. If the entry of net amount is required, “Prices include sales tax” needs to be marked in the document header, tab Setup (test case in chapter Entry of Net amount). 
2. Item sales tax group (from procurement category) and sales tax group (from vendor) are automatically populated in the line details – Setup. 
3. “Sales tax” button (in tab Purchase) shows sales tax transactions via sales tax codes (income tax, contributions, and deductions for the chosen income type).
4. The new tab “Personal tax” is added to line details. Here, specific real estate data can be entered such as Cadastral county, Plot, and Building number. A new purchase line is needed for each building number. REK reporting data is transferred to the vendor invoice, where it can be edited. 
5. Real estate data from vendor invoice is recorded in the area "Podatki o nepremičninah" on the iREK. Test case presented in chapter Reporting regarding real estate.
6. After the purchase order is confirmed, it can be linked to the vendor invoice. One purchase order can be mapped to one vendor invoice. 
7. Data from a purchase order is transferred to the vendor invoice. In Info part of vendor invoice under “Invoice totals” net amount of vendor payment can be seen (field Invoice amount) as well as personal tax amount in field Sales tax (income tax + deductions from gross).
8. Posting the vendor invoice results in posting vendor, Tax and GL transactions. 
9. **VAT date** in generated Tax transactions is left **empty** if **Post personal tax without VAT date** is set to **Yes** in Tax settlement period setup. 
 
### Separate number sequence for Purchase pool

1. Open Procurement and sourcing – Setup – Purchase orders – Purchase pools.
2. If using standard functionality for the massive creation of invoices, the localization allows defining Number sequence for invoices, created from purchase orders through the purchase pool. 
3. Navigate to Purchase pools and create a pool for REK-2. Define number sequence for invoices, which is the localization field.  
4. When generating invoices from purchase orders using the purchase pool, they are numbered according to the number sequence defined in the pool. If the number sequence is not defined, the invoice number has to be added manually. See chapter 9.19 for more details.

## **Payments**
---

1. Prepare vendor payment journal lines (e.g. through standard payment proposal functionality).
2. Net payment to the vendor is transferred to the payment journal line. 
3. Personal tax payment is executed at the same time as net payment. For that reason, the function with which personal tax payments are proposed is added to the payment journal. Payment lines to FURS and to the vendor are created in the same payment journal. 
4. Payment lines for deductions and contributions are created through Functions – Create personal tax payments. 
5. Enter the payment date and bank account to execute payments.
6. After confirming payment lines for deductions and contributions to FURS are created. 
 
Note: changing the amount on vendor payment line is not recorded in the REK-2 report. Test case presented in chapter Correcting payment journal line amount is not recorded in the report.

At this stage, it is already possible to create the REK-2 report (navigate to chapter REK-2 report for details). Correcting or deleting payment journal lines is not possible while the report exists, as lines are locked for editing. Correction is possible after deleting the existing REK-2 report.
Vendor payment journal lines are settled with the bank statements. After posting, transactions of personal tax payments are created on the FURS vendor.  
 
### Payment compensation

1. Function “Create personal tax payments” in the payment journal has been updated to allow the creation of personal tax payments for transactions that have been compensated. Option “Include” personal tax payments for the closed transaction has been added. 
2. Enter the payment date and bank account to execute payments. In “Closed transactions” section mark field “Include” and enter “From date, To date” (date period of settlement of compensated transactions). After confirming, personal tax payment lines are created in vendor payment journal.
