# REK-1
-----

REK-1 is a Slovenian personal tax report, which legal entities or natural persons who perform business activities are obliged to report to Slovenian tax authority (FURS) if they pay incomes from employment. Report layout and the required conditions are based on the paragraph 8, Article 58 of the Tax Procedure Act - ZDavP-2.

Since salaries are standardly not calculated in D365, Slovenian REK-1 reporting feature enables only the generation of the legally required reporting in terms of employee travel expenses. Transactions for REK-1 reporting are generated automatically from expense reports and invoices for travel expenses, but they can also be manually added. Export (XML) in the format, required by the Slovenian tax authorities and a preview (html) of REK-1 report are also part of this localized feature.

# REK-2

REK-2 is a Slovenian personal tax report, which taxpayers are legally (ZDoh-2) obliged to report to Slovenian tax authority (FURS) if they pay income, other than income from the employment. A taxpayer may also authorize another person to calculate and pay tax on his behalf. The data shall be reported to the tax authority (FURS) by all taxpayers when the payment of other income according to ZDoh-2 (excluding income from employment), from which the tax, the withholding tax and social security contributions are paid:
-	income from another contractual relationship,
-	income from activities,
-	income from letting out property,
-	income from transfer of property right,
-	other income (Article 104 ZDoh-2),
-	interest and dividends.

In terms of this localization feature, REK-2 report generation is enabled for Slovenian legal entities. Transaction amounts, required to be reported with REK-2 are calculated using vendor invoices and tax codes with separate Settlement period type. Reports can be generated at the time when adequate transactions are added to payment journal. REK-2 report can be previewed (html) and exported in the XML format, structured in a way to comply with the requirements of the Slovenian tax authority (FURS).

Additionally, this localization feature enables Slovenian legal entities to create Notices of payment for paid and not yet paid contractual work and Summary statements of income. Summary statement of income for each customer (contractor) can be generated after income payments have been posted. Thus, both documents are used to inform the payees (contractors) about the income, taxes and payment of contributions. Additionally, both â€“ Notice of payment and Summary statement of income can be exported to various formats (e.g. Word or PDF).
