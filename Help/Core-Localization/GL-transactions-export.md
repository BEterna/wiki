This topic provides country/region-specific information about exporting the General ledger transactions. For audition purposes, in order to comply with Slovenian legislation, General ledger transactions need to be available to be exported if required by the authorised Slovenian auditors, according to the Slovenian auditing law (ZRev-2).

Localised feature enables Slovenian legal entities to export General ledger transactions within the specified period to a CSV file.
