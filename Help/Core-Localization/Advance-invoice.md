# Advance invoices

Local tax authorities require VAT eligible companies that receive/give prepayments and will not deliver/receive products or services within the same tax period to report VAT from the received/given prepayment transactions in the same period as the prepayment has been given/received. In order to comply with local legislation, the purpose of this functionality is to enable posting the VAT from the received/given prepayments as soon as payments are posted.

This localized functionality allows for the sales or purchases advance invoice generation, processing and posting based on the posted received/given prepayments. Posting advance invoice post only the calculated VAT amount from the prepayment transactions to both - general ledger and VAT entry. When the final (original) invoice is posted, VAT from with the invoice settled advance invoice is automatically reversed and VAT of the final (original) invoice is posted. If only a partial amount of prepayment is applied, a proportional share of the Advance invoice will be reversed. Advance invoices can be either settled with sales or purchase documents or manually. VAT reversal occurs with the settlement.

## **Setup**
---

### Vendor posting profiles

1. Open **Accounts payable > Setup > Vendor posting profiles**.
2. Setup a specific vendor posting profile for posting prepayments (please note, the content of the setup is country-related). Selecting the main account in the “Sales tax prepayments” field is mandatory if the option “Sales tax on prepayment in payment journal” in Accounts payable parameters are marked. Otherwise, the payment of prepayment cannot be posted in the payment journal. 
 
### Advance invoice journal

1. Open **Accounts payable > Payment setup > Prepayment journal names**.
2. Create a new entry, enter the name, and select journal type “Prepayment to vendors”. Define voucher series for posting advance invoices, and select Amounts in the journal include sales tax (amounts, including VAT, are entered on the advance invoice).

### Accounts payable parameters

1. Open **Accounts payable > Setup > Accounts payable parameter**s.
2. BE-terna localization: Navigate to the BE-terna localization section and enable prepayments by selecting “Yes” in the Use prepayments field. Select advance invoice journal name for reversal transaction in the field “Reversal journal name”. If advance invoices functionality is used as shown in the test case “Purchase order and prepayment invoice” then reversal of advance invoice uses the voucher set up on this journal. 
3. Ledger and sales tax: Navigate to Ledger and sales tax section, tab Payment, and select Posting profile for payment journal with prepayment. When the payment journal line is marked as prepayment, posting profile changes to the selected one. Mark “Yes” for sales tax on prepayment in payment journal included in the amount. In this case, the posting profile should have the main account for “Sales tax prepayments” (see Chapter 1.1). 
4. On the tab Prepayment invoice, select the Posting profile with which prepayment invoices will be posted. This setup will be used only in cases when posting definitions are not in use. Otherways setup from posting definitions is used for posting prepayment invoices.  
 
### Procurement category for prepayments

1. Open **Procurement and sourcing > Procurement categories**.
2. If prepayments will be recorded in connection with purchase orders and prepayment invoices, create a new procurement category.
 
#### Posting setup for procurement category

1. Set up the main account for posting liability for payment of prepayment.
 
### Ledger posting groups

1. Open **Tax > Setup > Sales tax > Ledger posting groups**.
2. If sales tax from prepayment should be posted on the separate main accounts, create a new Ledger posting group with a sales tax receivable account and settlement account. 
3. Select this ledger posting group in the localization field Ledger posting group for tax in prepayments. 
4. If no separate ledger posting group is specified, sales tax from prepayments will be posted with the sales tax receivable main account from the used ledger posting group.

### Sales tax code

1. Open **Tax > Indirect taxes > Sales tax > Sales tax codes**.
2. Some countries might wish to record separate sales tax codes for advance invoices (e.g. Serbia). In this case, create a separate sales tax code.


 
## **Generate Prepayment invoice**
---

1. Open **Accounts payable > Payments > Prepayment vendor invoice journal.**
2. Create **New** journal and Click on **Lines** to enter the journal.
3. Navigate to **Functions > create prepayment proposal**.   
4. Enter **“From date”** and **“To date”** to filter out payment transactions marked as prepayment. Optionally, enter the **Posting date** and **VAT date** that Prepayment invoices will be generated with. Confirm the date parameters.<br>
_Note: in case of prepayment invoice, the date for the filter is the posting date of liability (posting date of prepayment invoice) and not the payment date of the prepayment invoice._
6. **Prepayment invoice header** is generated in the upper section of the journal. If the prepayment was generated as part of the purchase order the invoice line is generated automatically. If there is no purchase order or the payment of prepayment was not linked to one, the line is not generated. Infolog appears: “Prepayment is not completely allocated to orders.” In this case, manually add the line: 
   - If there is no purchase order, add a line with Item type “Text” and insert necessary data (quantity, amount, and sales tax group are populated automatically, enter item sales tax group). 
   - If there is a purchase order that has not been linked, select item type “item”, select purchase order and order line – quantity, amount, and sales tax data will transfer automatically. <br>

7. Upon saving the line, the Voucher amount/Line amount and Voucher VAT/Line VAT fields are calculated. For countries that use separate sales tax codes for the advance invoice (e.g. Serbia), it is necessary to change the item sales tax group after the line generation. **Sales tax** for individual prepayment invoice line can be checked before posting by navigating to **Inquiries > Sales tax**.
8. **Enter** Document receipt date, Document date, VAT date, and advance invoice number.
10. **Post** Prepayment journal. Posting the journal posts only VAT.
