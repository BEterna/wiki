REK-1 is a Slovenian personal tax report, which legal entities or natural persons who perform business activities are obliged to report to the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) if they pay incomes from employment. Report layout and the required conditions are based on paragraph 8, Article 58 of the Tax Procedure Act - ZDavP-2.

Since salaries are standardly not calculated in D365, the Slovenian REK-1 reporting feature enables only the generation of the legally required reporting in terms of employee travel expenses. Transactions for REK-1 reporting are generated automatically from expense reports and invoices for travel expenses, but they can also be manually added. Export (XML) in the format, required by the Slovenian tax authorities and a preview (HTML) of the REK-1 report are also part of this localized feature.
