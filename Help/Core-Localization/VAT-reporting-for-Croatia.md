## **PDV-S and ZP (Zbirna Prijava) report - VIES** ##
-----
PDV-S and ZP (Zbirna Prijava) report is a recapitulative report in which taxable entities, identified for VAT purposes in Croatia are obliged to report the supplies of goods or services to (ZN report) and from (PDV-S) legal entities from other EU member states, which are identified for VAT in Member States of the European Union during the reporting period. Along with entities, registered in the VAT system, buyers who are not eligible (do not charge) for VAT – but have had an acquisition of goods of value, higher then the legally required threshold, also have to submit both forms. Both – ZN and PDV-S reports have to be submitted to the Croatian tax authority.

PDV-S and ZP (Zbirna Prijava) report processes the intra-community transactions based on the delivery address of the documents (Sales invoices, Free text invoices, Project invoices, Vendor invoices) if country code from that address is specified for the EU trade. Selected transactions are transferred to EU sales list journal, if they meet the predetermined criterion. Additional localized information are available to be added to these transactions (e.g. Customs procedure 42 or 63). In contrary to the standard, localized feature allows reporting transactions based on the VAT (and not transaction) date. Two separate reports – PDV-S and ZP report can then be generated. Both reports can be printed or exported to an adequate XML file format, required by the Croatian tax authority. All transactions can be also manually marked as included, reported or closed.
