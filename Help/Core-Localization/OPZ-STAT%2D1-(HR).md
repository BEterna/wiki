# OPZ STAT-1 report

In order to comply with the Croatian legislation (Pravilnik o obvezujućim mišljenjima, ispravku prijave, statističkim izvješćima i poreznoj nagodbi (NN 78/15). OPZ STAT 1 is a mandatory statistical report, required by the Croatian tax authority. OPZ STAT 1 includes the overdue, but uncollected claims which legal entity has towards its customers. The report must be submitted to the Croatian tax authority in the prescribed XML file format on a yearly basis. It is important to note that taxpayers must report only the overdue but uncollected receivables, which are not older than 6 years on the day of the reporting. The taxpayer is therefore not obliged to hand over OPZ STAT 1 report if there are no overdue but uncollected receivables in one of the above-mentioned periods. Transactions need to be reported in Croatian local currency (HRK) no matter the original currency of the document. Realized FX differences are also taken into consideration within the report.

This localization feature allows the preparation generation of the OPZ STAT 1 report. The report includes outgoing invoices from goods and services, but not also advances and credit notes. The report can be exported only as an XML file format, required by the Croatian tax authorities.

## **Setup**
---

### Company setup (standard fields)

1. Open Organization administration/Organizations/Legal entities.
2. For reporting purposes following setup needs to be done (no localized fields needed): 
   - Name of the taxpayer
   - OIB number
   - Address of the taxpayer
   - E-mail address

### Customer setup

1. Open Accounts receivable/Customers/All customers.
2. Following customer data is needed for reporting purposes: 
   - Name 
   - OIB (LOC field)/Tax exempt number
   - Sales tax group

### Sales tax group setup (standard)

1. Open Tax/Indirect taxes/Sales tax/Sales tax groups.
2. If the value of EU trade is Yes, transactions with this Sales tax group will be printed in group 2 of the report. If the value is set to No, transactions will be printed in group 3. Valid only for customers with tax exempt numbers entered. In the case of customers with OIB, this setup is irrelevant.

### Responsible person setup (standard fields)

1. Open Human resources/Workers/Employees.
2. For reporting purposes following Employee data from the Contact information detail is needed (no localized fields added):
   - First and last name
   - Phone number
   - FAX number
   - E-mail address

### Electronic reporting setup

1. Open General ledger/Ledger setup/General ledger parameters/BE-terna localization/Electronic reporting.
2. If report configuration is changed following steps need to be done: 
   - Delete OPZ STAT-1 configuration
   - Reimport OPZ STAT-1 configuration
 
We need to wait for a message from the system, which says that import is complete. After that new configuration is available in General ledger parameters/Electronic reporting. 

### OPZ STAT-1 Opening balance setup

1. Open Accounts receivable/Customers/All customers/Transactions.
2. Two localized fields are added to customer transactions for OPZ STAT-1 reporting purposes:
   - Original Invoice amount
   - Original VAT amount

They need to be populated only in case of importing Customer open balances, that was partially closed before import. This means that open amount is different from the original amount. Amounts need to be entered in HRK (even if the original was different). 

The migration of these two fields is enabled also through a data entity: Customer transactions (localization data). When migrating data user should be aware of the following limitations:
- The data entity enables the import only for customer transactions of the type: Customer, Interest, General ledger.
- The key to identify a customer transaction is: customer account & invoice number & transaction date & voucher.
- If multiple customer transactions are found with a specific combination of the key fields, such import will result in error and for such customer transaction a manual approach must be used.
 
For reporting purposes, field Document date (standard field) also needs to be populated with the original Invoice date. 
For all other transactions, generated in the system (not part of opening balances import) original amounts are used for reporting and described fields do not need to be populated.
