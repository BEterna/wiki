In order to comply with the Croatian legislation (Pravilnik o obvezujućim mišljenjima, ispravku prijave, statističkim izvješćima i poreznoj nagodbi (NN 78/15). OPZ STAT 1 is a mandatory statistical report, required by the Croatian tax authority. OPZ STAT 1 includes the overdue, but uncollected claims which legal entity has towards its customers. Report must be submitted to Croatian tax authority in the prescribed XML file format on a quarterly basis. It is important to note that taxpayers must report only the overdue but uncollected receivables, which are not older than 6 years on the day of the reporting. Taxpayer is therefore not obliged to hand over OPZ STAT 1 report if there are no overdue but uncollected receivables in one of the above-mentioned periods. Transactions need to be reported in Croatian local currency (HRK) no matter the original currency of the document. Realized FX differences are also taken into consideration within the report.

This localization feature allows the preparation generation of the OPZ STAT 1 report. Report includes outgoing invoices from goods and services, but not also advances and credit notes. Report can be exported only as an XML file format, required by the Croatian tax authorities.
