# Print list of incoming and outgoing invoices

A taxable person filing a VAT return (DDV-O) for the first time must attach a list of the incoming (PR) and outgoing (IR) invoices that served as the basis for preparing the VAT return. These two lists must also be available to be sent to the Slovenian tax authority if required directly by the authority and therefore need to be available to be extracted from the ERP.

IR and PR reports are prepared based on Tax transactions amd according to VAT date. Both reports can be exported to various format (e.g. Word, PDF or Excel). A special export in the format, required by the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) is also available for IR and PR. All reports are prepared using Slovenian sales tax reporting codes.
