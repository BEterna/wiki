# How to: Prepare VIES Report (EU Sales list) 

VIES report is a report in which taxable entities, identified for VAT purposes in Slovenia are obliged to report the supplies of goods and services that are delivered to entities, identified for VAT in the other Member States of the European Union during the reporting period (the calendar month). VIES report needs to be submitted to the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) till the 20th in the following month after the occurrence of the reporting events.

VIES (recapitulative report) processes the transactions, considered as intra-community trade transactions based on the delivery address of the documents (Sales invoices, Free text invoices, Project invoices, Vendor invoices) if country code from that address is specified for the EU trade. Selected transactions are then transferred to the EU sales list journal if they meet the predetermined criterion. Additional localized information is available to be added to these transactions (e.g. Customs procedure 42 or 63). In contrary to the standard, localized feature reports transactions based on the VAT (and not transaction) date. VIES report can be exported either to an Excel file (standard) or to an adequate XML file format (localization), accepted by the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) portal eDavki and previewed prior to export. After generating an EU Sales list report for a specific period, it is also possible to mark the records that are included in the report by setting the Reporting status value to Reported and Closed when for example tax authorities have accepted the report.

## **Working with the EU Sales list** 
-------

### EU transactions 

Transactions of the following types can be considered intra-community trade transactions: 
   - Sales invoices  
   - Free text invoices  
   - Project invoices  
   - Vendor invoices 
   - Transfer orders (SI localization) 
   - Transfer journals (SI localization) 

Additionally, consignment transactions need to be reported when goods are transferred to/from consignment warehouse that is in another EU member state. For this purpose, additional types of documents are added to reporting as part of Slovenian localization.  

A transaction is considered an intra-community trade transaction if the delivery address of the transaction is in a member state of the EU. For such countries, a record of Country/region type “EU” should exist on the Country/region parameters tab of the Foreign trade parameters page.  

Intra-community trade transactions are marked in the “List code” field. If the delivery address is one of the Countries/regions with Country/region type “EU”, specified in Country/region parameters of the Foreign trade parameters page, then the value in this field is automatically set to “EU trade”. Using this field, you can also separate general intra-community trade transactions from triangular trade transactions. Localization added option is “Customs procedure 42 or 63”. 

### EU sales list journal 

1. Open Tax – Declarations – Foreign trade – EU Sales list.
2. You can collect information about intra-EU trade transactions on the EU Sales list page by using the “Transfer” function. This function lets you include transactions of different reporting types (i.e., items or services), according to the item sales tax groups that are specified on transaction lines.  
The Transfer function creates a record on the EU Sales list journal for each transaction that corresponds to selected parameters. Counterparty account number, country/region, tax exempt number, and invoice number and date are transferred. The list code value is copied from the transaction. You can manually change the list code for a transaction on the EU Sales list page. Additional localization value is “Customs procedure 42 or 63”. 
3. The Transfer function creates records with the Reporting status value set to Included. 

You can validate the information that is collected on the EU Sales list page by using the “Validate” function. 

### EU sales list journal - Consignment reporting 

Transfers to/from consignment warehouses located in another EU member state are collected in Consignment Tab.  They are generated by using the Transfer consignment function.

1. Open Tax – Declarations – Foreign trade – EU Sales list – Consignment.
2. “From” or “To” Warehouse nedds to have following parameters set:  
   - The customer field must be populated.
   - EU Sales list Excluded parameter must be set to NO.
   - Warehouse Address needs to be in the EU.
3. Following transaction types can be generated:  
   - Issue: non-consignment warehouse > consignment warehouse; Shipment  
   - Return: consignment warehouse > non-consignment warehouse; Receive 
   - Transfer: consignment warehouse > consignment warehouse; Shipment and Receive 

### **Generating EU sales list report** 
-----

EU Sales list transactions are reported according to VAT date in localization (contrary to invoice date in standard). 

1. You can generate a report by using the “Reporting” function:  
   - Select a Reporting period and define the first date of the reporting month; “To date” is automatically calculated.  
   - Enable “Generate file” if XML file for download should be generated and enter “File name” of the XML export file. You can also choose to generate a preview report by enabling the “Generate report” and entering “Report file name”.  
   - Localization enables you to choose Worker that will be displayed as a contact person on the report. The worker’s telephone number, if entered on the worker, will also transfer to the report as a contact number. 
2. After confirmation, an XML file is available for download if the “Generate file” was selected:
   - If the “Generate report” is selected, the file for downloading is a preview of transactions in Excel format. In general, preview consists of separate lines that list the total amounts of supplies per counterparty country/region, tax exempt number, and reporting type. 
   - If Report format mapping “EU Sales list by rows report” is selected in Foreign trade parameters, the preview report is displayed by report type in rows. This is a standard EU Sales list and it ignores all localized specifics.   
   - If Report format mapping “EU Sales list by columns report” is selected in Foreign trade parameters, the preview report is displayed by report type in columns. This is a standard EU Sales list and it ignores all localized specifics. 

Another localization option is to select “Send electronically”. For this to be enabled, you need to select the “Generate file” first. The file name is a mandatory field. 

This option creates a record in Tax – Declarations – Slovenia – VAT – VIES recapitulative forms, which can be previewed in e-Davki format or exported to the XML file. 

#### Reporting status 

After you generate an EU Sales list report for a specific period, you can mark the records that are included in the report by setting the Reporting status value to Reported. To set this status, use the “Mark” -> “Mark as reported” function on the EU Sales list page. 

When you have completed the reporting process for a specific period (for example, when tax authorities have accepted the EU Sales list report), you can mark the records as Closed.  

Setting the Reporting status value to “Included” will revert the closing of the period. These records can then be included on EU Sales list report again. You can select to view transactions according to their status.  

#### Corrections 

Localization allows users to report corrections for previous periods. Standard feature enables marking corrected transaction (field “Corrected” in the EU sales list transaction line). Localization feature changes this logic with marking correcting transactions, opposite to standard functionality where corrected transactions are marked.   

Additionally Date of original document is added. This information is needed for section B reporting. 

Reporting date determines the period in which the correction is reported. 

All documents marked as correction are reported in section B of the report. Cases listed below, are supported:  
   - One credit note, one invoice; Invoice value > credit note value. Expected result: New value is the difference between reported summarized value for the corrected period for selected VAT ID and summarized value of corrections for the reporting period for selected VAT ID.  
   - One credit note, multiple invoices from different periods; Invoice value in last period > Credit note value. Expected result: New value is the difference between reported summarized value for the corrected period (period of last settled invoice) for selected VAT ID and summarized value of corrections for reporting period for selected VAT ID.  
   - One credit note, multiple invoices from different periods; Invoice value in last period < Credit note value. Expected result: New value is the summarized value of corrections for reporting period for selected VAT ID. Value needs to be adjusted manually. 
   - Credit note without the settlement. Expected result: New value is the summarized value of corrections for reporting period for selected VAT ID. The value needs to be adjusted manually. 

#### Corrections – Consignment transactions 

Corrections of consignment transactions need to be entered manually. Process description:  
1. Enter new line.
2. Enter new line to Consignment Tab and enter correct data that needs to be reported.
3. Go to Consignment correction tab and Set “Corrected” tab to Yes.
4. From dropdown list pick original consignment that is being corrected 
5. Enter Correction type.

Correction transactions will be then reported in sections F or G of the report.
