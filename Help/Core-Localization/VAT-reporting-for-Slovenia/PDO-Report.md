# How To: Prepare PDO report

PDO report is a report required by the Slovenian tax authority regarding the supply of goods and services for which the recipient (and not the provider of goods or services) is a VAT payer according to the 76.a Article of the Slovenian sales tax law (ZDDV-1), where specific services for which this is applicable is also defined – e.g. construction work related services. Slovenian taxable persons, which perform these activities, must notice the Slovenian tax authority about their activities within 30 days of their occurrence. PDO report needs to be submitted electronically until the last day of the following month after deliveries of such goods or services occurred. Reporting is done through eDavki portal of the Slovenian tax authority (FURS).

PDO reports sums transactions based on tax exempt numbers. The report consists of A (information about the deliveries for the current period) and B part (information about the corrections for previous periods). PDO report can be previewed (HTML) and exported as an XML file, using the adequate model for reporting to the Slovenian tax authority (FURS) portal eDavki.
