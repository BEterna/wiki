# eInvoices for Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia

An electronic invoice (eInvoice) is sent electronically over the internet, rather than being paper-based, and can be easily integrated into a customer's accounts payable system. In Slovenia and Croatia, eInvoices are mandatory to be used for the country budget users (governmental bodies) according to current local legislation (e.g. ZOPSPU - The law on the provision of payment services to budget users in case of Slovenia). 

This localized feature enables the following processes:
- Customer eInvoices: setting up, generate, process, review, sign (SI) and export customer eInvoices, in accordance with the supported local eInvoice formats (e.g. eSlog in case of Slovenia), which local (Slovenian or Croatian) budget users currently use. Using this localization feature, eInvoices can be created automatically when posting customer or project invoices and exported to the required XML formats. 
- Vendor invoices: setting up, import and process vendor eInvoices in accordance with the supported local eInvoice formats. Using this localization feature, vendor eInvoices can be imported either automatically from a specific provider or manually by uploading the XML file in a local eInvoice format and then automatically processed to automatically generate pending vendor invoice documents in D365FO Accounts Payable module.
