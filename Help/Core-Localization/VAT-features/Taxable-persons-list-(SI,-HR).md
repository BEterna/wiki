# How to: Add additional information on Taxable person list
 
A taxable person list is added in the scope of Slovenian and Croatian localization. Slovenian list stores information, such as tax registration number, company registration number, taxable person type, name, address, and special handling (e.g. 76.a ZDDV-1) checkmark, while Croatian list stores the following information: OIB, identification number, type, and name. This list can later be used when adding VAT ID to Vendor or Customer. 

_*List of Taxable persons can also be imported. Import is enabled as part of a separate Tax package._
