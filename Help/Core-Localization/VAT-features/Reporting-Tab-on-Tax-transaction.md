## **Reporting Tab data on Journals**
----

When Journals are used, **reporting data is defaulted** from Vendor/Customer line to other lines within the same Voucher. This is useful in cases, when journals are used for posting invoices. Without dafaulting user would have to populate the fields, used for reporting (these are fields that get transferred to Reporting tab on Tax trandasction) manually on all the lines that generate tax transactions. 

New field, **Tax reporting number**, is added to journal. There is no validation on this field. It is **filled automatically** from the fields in following order: 
1. VAT ID on Vendor/Customer
1. Tax registration number on Vendor/Customer
1. Registration ID of type VAT ID
1. Registration ID of type Tax registration number


Functions **Post** and **Simulate posting** trigger copying the data from Vendor/Customer line to other lines. Only empty fields will get populated by copying from Vendor/Customer line.  

Following data gets transferred from Vendor/Customer line to other lines within the same Voucher: 
- Customer/Vendor 
- Address 
- Tax exempt number 
- Tax reporting number 
- Document 
- Document date 
- Document receipt date 
- Invoice
