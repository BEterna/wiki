# Create a PDV form 

PDV report is a Croatian sales tax return report. Every taxable person identified for VAT purposes is obliged to submit a VAT return to the Croatian tax authority. The report consists of sums of sales tax from both payable and receivable transactions, according to different sales tax rates. Taxable entities must submit the PDV report electronically via the ePorezna portal of the Croatian tax authority.

## **Setup**
----

### Legal Entity - Tax reporting number 
Go to Organization administration > Legal entities > open specific Legal entity > Tag reporting tab. 
**Enter OIB** in Tax registration number field. **Important**: Do not enter VAT ID in this field since all reports use this field as OIB.

### Legal Entity - Address
Go to Organization administration > Legal entities > open specific Legal entity > Address. Enter Legal entity address. Information is used for reporting purposes. 

### Legal Entity - Area and Branch identification
Go to Organization administration > Legal entities > open specific Legal entity > Statutory reporting. Enter **Area** (one letter) and **Branch** (four-digit number). Setup is related to the national classification of the legal entity and information is used for reporting purposes. 

###Sales tax authorities - report layout

To generate a VAT declaration in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the **report layout** for the sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Croatian report layout**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used in the sales tax codes. 

###Sales tax authorities - responsible person
When generating XML, it is mandatory to report **responsible person** for the preparation of report. Setup exists on Tax authorities form. Currently fields Responsible person first name and Responsible person last name need to be added to the form using personalization. 

####Sales tax reporting codes

The generation of reports is based on reporting codes. Reporting code carries information about which field the transaction will be recorded in. 

1. Open **Tax > Setup > Sales tax > Sales tax reporting codes**:
   - Enter the list of **reporting codes for Croatia** [Sales tax reporting codes_HR.zip](/.attachments/Sales%20tax%20reporting%20codes_HR-3add9eb0-1edb-4655-b0b0-6db768d218ca.zip). Reporting codes can also be imported using Excel add-in. 
2. Open **Tax > Indirect taxes > Sales tax > Sales tax codes**:
   - VAT reports are generated according to the setup of sales tax reporting codes on sales tax codes.  

####Configure Electronic reporting 

First make sure, that BE-terna localization ER configurations are imported. In case they are missing, you will need to import them first. Instructions are available on [**this link**](/How-to/Import-BE%2Dterna-ER-configurations). 

Open Electronic reporting formats setup in General ledger > General ledger parameters > BE-terna localization. To generate PDV form, electronic reporting formats need to be configured first. Two formats are available for PDV form:
